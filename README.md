Classify Clothes Using Python and Artificial Neural Networks

I started to practice with Tensorflow library in Python to understand AI. I worked with artificial neural network model and I did a project about clothes classification.

For training and testing the model I used #Keras and worked with Mnist digits classification dataset. https://lnkd.in/gfkEGXFa

There were 60k train images and 10k test images in the dataset and I achieved %81 accuracy for prediction of clothes labels.
